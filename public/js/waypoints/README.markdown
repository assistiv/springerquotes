# jQuery Waypoints

Waypoints is a small jQuery plugin that makes it easy to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element.

    $('.entry').waypoint(function() {
       alert('You have scrolled to an entry.');
    });

[Read the full documentation](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/#documentation) for more details on usage and customization.

## Examples

Waypoints can be used as a base for several common scroll-based UI patterns. Check out these examples of:

- [Infinite Scrolling](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/infinite-scroll)
- [Sticky Elements](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/sticky-elements)
- [Scroll Analytics](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/scroll-analytics)
