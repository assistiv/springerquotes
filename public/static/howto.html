	<h2>How does this work?</h2>
	
	<p>
		This application allows you to directly link to a paragraph of a Springer article or to highlight individual sentences. This makes it more convenient to share information with fellow researchers and to point them directly to specific portions of an article. This could as well be used to directly link to when you are citing from a scientific paper.
